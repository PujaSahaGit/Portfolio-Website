Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/;[12] Sanskrit: कृष्ण IAST: Kṛṣṇa [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ]) is a major deity in Hinduism. The name comes from a Sanskrit word (कृष्ण, kṛṣṇa) that means "black", "dark", "dark blue" or “the all attractive”.[13] He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme god in his own right.[14] He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love;[15][1] and is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities.[16] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.[17][18]
